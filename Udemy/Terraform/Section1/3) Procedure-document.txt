AWS Setup
There is a lecture on how to setup AWS, here are some notes to clarify the setup
Make sure you have installed the AWS CLI
if you use my vagrant devops-box it is included by default
otherwise you can download it manually from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
If you're on linux you can also use "sudo pip install --upgrade awscli"
If you don't have pip, try sudo apt-get install python-pip
There is a lecture on how to add an admin user, this need to be done to create an access key and secret key
Use "aws configure" to enter the keys
you can optionally specify a default region - but no worries, in terraform you can set any region you want
Use http://www.cloudping.info/ to determine your region
You can test whether it works by entering: aws iam get-user
This will also show your AWS userid which you need afterwards
Useful Commands
$ terraform plan                                  # plan

$ terraform apply                                 # shortcut for plan & apply - avoid this in production

$ terraform plan -out out.terraform      # terraform plan and write the plan to out file

$ terraform apply out.terraform            # apply terraform plan using out file

$ terraform show                                  # show current state

$ cat terraform.tfstate                           # show state in JSON format



Using putty instead of the ssh command
The course is explained using MacOS/Linux. If you rather want to use putty, use the following steps to create your SSH keypair:

Download Putty and PuttyGen from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Launch PuttyGen and click the "Generate" button to generate a new public/private key
You can enter a passphrase or leave it blank
Save the public and private keys by clicking the Save public key and Save private key buttons
