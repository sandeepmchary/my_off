Each Linux cmd returns a status when it is executed
- we can display the exist status of a cmd with echo $?
x=$?(storing exit status of a cmd into a variable)
- 0 exit status means the cmd was successful without any errors

- A non-zero(1-255 values) exit status means cmd was failure
- Ex:
	-127 - cmd not fount
	- 1- cmd failed during execution
	- 2- incorrect cmd usage etc ..
