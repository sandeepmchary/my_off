why the merge is imp?
 -- 
 - master branch is only for the release based
 - all the features that need to added for that we need to create the branch and 
   do all the features stuff and then merge it with master
-----------------------
create a file in the branch develop
- under develop branch
 -- touch file1
   -- vi file1
      --- this is the file1 in the develop branch
      :wq!
---------------------------------
git add .
git commit -m "added files for the file1"
git push origin develop(not master REMEMBER)
***************************************************************************
now come to the master branch
- git merge develop
- if we not changed any file1 lines,we can add the lines but not the changed the 
lines which are already there
- we don't get merge conflicts
- we change the lines in the file1 which are already there then git will throw an error
- merge conflicts, we need to sit with the developer and check which line needs to be 
present and which lines need to be removed
-
