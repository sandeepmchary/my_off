What happens to public ip if we restart?
 - it changes
what happens to public ip if we reboot?
 - It remains the same
-----------------------
- stop -> start -> public ip changes reboot -> pub ip same
- stop -> start -> public ip,instances attached to hypervisior(xen),next thing they 
are changing KVM now there are in  Nitro,Changes to another hypervisior
- where as in reboot,boot on same hypervisior,public ip remains same
- system status check
  - checks level to be done on hypervisior level
- Instance status check
  - kernel level changes
  - mount root volume to some other file
  - or go to init level 1
  - changes in fstabs
- Ex:
     SCENARIO:
           - Instance changes from m4 to m5 large,we have to change something in the
           fstab & kernel lvl files,after this instances is not rebooting
           - After that we have system status check and instances status check failures
           - so,we unmounted the ebs volume to another ec2 instance and changed the fstab files
           - then we mounted the root volume after that it got correct

- Elastic Ip:
   - go to Elastic ip 
     --> Associate Elastic Ip --> actions --> Associate Elastic ip 
     --> choose the instance --> Associate
   - if we allocate the EIP, the first ip will be gone
   - Eip will be still attached to the instance even after the stop state
   - Disassociate
- PRIVATE SERVER
  - mostly this is used for storing the database
  - to login to private server we need to login to the server 
  which has public ip with in the same subnet and VPC
  - Attach the EIP here we cannot ping to google.com
  - Even though it has public ip, we cannot access this ping google.com,becoz we dont have
  route to internet gateway and it's in the private subnet
  - here we need NAT gateway,NAT gateway is only for outbound
  - to add the nat gateway
  - create a nat gateway
  - Attach it to the public subnet
  - allocate EIP
  - Key(name)     : Value(nat-gw)
  - IT will take some time
  - add this to private route table
  - 0.0.0.0/0 nat-gw 
  - save route
