- Containers are very good way to bundle and run your applications,In a production environment you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime and that's where kubernetes come to picture
- kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed system resilently.It takes care of the scaling and failover for ur app/.. provides deployment patterns and more
- rolling updates
	- updates one by one with updated containers
-----------------------
- why kubernetes ?
	- monolithic all code at once like uber
		- Location services
		- customer care
		- Notifications
		- Mail
		- Payments
		- Passenger Management
	- previously all come from one server
	- all in one code base
	- if we want to change the code/update in Passenger management, chances are there that other services may or maynot come down or malfunction 
	- lot of dependency b/w all the features 
	- Microservies s/w app/
		- all the features have diff code base and deployed seperatly 
		- connected with API and json 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- what is the command to create the kubernetes services 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- kubernetes features
	- Managing multiple containers as one entity
	- Resource usage monitor
	- N/W
	- Rolling update
	- Load balancing
	- Health Checks
- How kubernetes works
	- K master
		- K-Node-1
		- K-Node-2
		- K-Node-3
		- K-Node-.
	- kubernetes is basically a cluster, we have master and we have several nodes 
	- job of the master is schedule the container on the nodes
	- monitor the nodes
	- monitor the container in each node
	- keep the track of the node,logs and what operations are performed on the each container
	- node does the job of processing
	- kubernetes is running on both master and the node 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Kubernetes ARCHITECTURE
	- Master
		- etcd : It stores conf info which can be used by each of the nodes in the cluster.it is high availbilty key value store that can be distributed among multiple nodes
				- These config are accessible only by the Kubernetes API servers as it may have some sensitive info.It is a distributed key value store which is accessible to all
		- API server
		- kube-controller-manager
		- Scheduler
		- cloud-controller-manager
