resource "aws_vpc" "samantha_vpc"{
here the vpc is not yet created, for creating the subnet we need the vpc which we dont have for now 
so we have to take the "provider_resource_type.name.id"
- what is data source
    - if any of the existing resource is already there then we can get the info from it

- terraform destroy type.name
- this is very risky we have destroyed the type with a command but it is in the configuration 
part if we run again it will crated the destroyed part again, best is to remove from the file
itself or else comment it out 
 - /* starting of the line
   ending of the line
   */
- always go with config files only 
- DONT DO IT WITH TARGET
