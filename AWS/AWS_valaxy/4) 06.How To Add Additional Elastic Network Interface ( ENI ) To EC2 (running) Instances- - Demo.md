4) Adding additional elastic network interface (ENI) to EC2 running instance 
One instance have only one private IP address there can be a question sometimes we can have some can we have more than one interface it might from different subnets or different security group, so that we can make the instance talk to each other 

---- how to assign more than one private IP/Public IP address to server ---- 
To check the interface and IP address from the console 
# ifconfig -a 

Adding one more interface 
>> Network and security 
>> network interface  
>> create new interface 
>> description < give any name > 
>> the security group should be one of our security groups 
>> things we have to check for here are << 
>> EC2 & network interface should be in same region 
>> select security group from which the instance is running 
>> this will give another Nic card (Network Interface )for private IP address 
---------------------------- 
--- for public IP ---- 
>> Go to elastic IP addresses 
>> allocate new address 
>> close 
--------------------------- 
Go to network interface select the newly created ENI (the name given in the description)
>> actions 
>> associate address 
>> select the address 
>> associated address 
---- one NIC card is attached to 1 EC2 instance at a time, we cannot attach multiple EC2 instance at a time 
>> Attach 
>> Instance ID (running)
>> attach 
>> go to EC2 dashboard 
>> quick refresh 
--- as per my knowledge we can attach to either a private IP and public IP but not the both 
--- to detach simply click detach and release from elastic IP also 
-- then delete network interface also (as this is chargable )
