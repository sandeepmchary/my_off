# aws ec2 auto-recovery
* these can be done when there is h/w or s/w failures
* we can starting, terminating,rebooting the instance
* when can passon on the lambda function also so that it can take ebs back shots, dettach the volume and attach the volume to another instance
* also we can do auto-scaling event also
* for this we need ec2 instance and cloud watch alarm
# steps

* copy the instance id 
* go to cloud watch dashboard
* create alarm
* select meric paste the instance id 
* check for the system status fail > next
* name and describe it
* whenever: statuscheckfailed-system
is --1
for --2
* period 1 min
* In actions -- send notification to : select any 
* under that we have EC2 actions: select any 
* create alarm
* at first it will be in INSUFFICIENT-DATA after 2 or 3 min.. it changes to ok state
* after changing to ok state click on history 
* from the cli commands we can trigger the h/w failures,
#
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
-- alarm-name "HW-Check" \
-- state-value ALARM \
-- state-reason "Simulate an EC2 HW System Failure"
#
* run the above commands with admin previalges
