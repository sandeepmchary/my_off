# Network Placement Group 
* cluster instance can be launched within a placement group 
* all instances low latency full bisection 
* 10gbps bandwidth between instances
* cannot span across availability zones 
* two placement Groups for each availability zone 
* The limitation if the server A has 10gbps and circuit B has 20 gbps if it is placed under under this placement group mostly obtains 10gbps only 
* communication should be within the private IP only 
* if the communication is public speed might down 5 gbps
# Steps
* network & security 
* create placement group 
* name it (this should be unique with the account) 
* It mainly uses c4 and m4 large instances only 
# uses this placement group 
* under launch 
* choose m4 and c4 
* under step3  configure instant details 
* number of instances upto 10 
* subnet : * choose any* 
* Placement Group :  * select the placement group created *
