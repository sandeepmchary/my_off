- trail this before
- reasons for the build delivery
- compile failed , dev team fixed
- servers unreachable, n/w team will fix this
- 
-Ex:
--- 10 servers - QA
--- 5 servers - performance
--- 2 servers - UAT

-------------------
pre build check list
- ex: At 11:30 we will circulate a email plz don't touch VCS
- mock builds: 11 am mock build, lock the branch at 11 am

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) N/W issues: 
server verification scripts
at 11:00 am
- ping
- disk Free space available at least 80%
- Service not running with root 
- software versions like JDK version my SQL 
- stop services
- 90% of issues will be sorted out 
Assume we have 4 people 
- 1-- QA 
- 2 -- performance 
- 3 -- UAT 
- 4 -- vcs and CI and CD 
- in the middle time we will automate the process 
- could you please tell me a great achievement in your company like which is not already there 
---- release the build, and give it to QA, start at 4:00 p.m. And at the 5:00 p.m. Environment is down, QA will send a email to build team at 5:00 p.m. Built team  look at that at 6:00 p.m., respond at 7:00 p.m. 
- 2 hours of QA Ideal to avoid this 
- write a script to avoid this 
- it should start automatically 
----------------------------------------------------- 
in the ideal time we explore new tools 
- POC of new tool 
- try with one application
- benefits of tools quality, time ,reporting ,feature 
- in 3.0 version we use Jenkins/teamcity if the release is successful(100%) 
- in 4.0 version they can role out Teamcity 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- I have total of 6.10 into IT for Devops i have 3.6 years of experience
- when comes to my roles as a part of Devops team working in the organization 
- we handle enter application build and release Management process 
- for every release it will keep changing 
- taking responsibility of version control system 
- implementing the branching strategy 
- implementing the access control on the VCS, and CI systems it our  responsibility to implement the CI across the project in the account 
- as a part of it we use tools like Jenkins 
- when comes to deployment part  we use ansible as deployment tool 
- we write all the ansible Playbooks 
- we check into git repository 
- we follow different release cycles like waterfall and V model 
- We have different types of releases each releases handled by one team member of our team 
- I deal with QA builds in our organization QA builds are done Monday and Thursday
- Builds will take in 12-3pm, i do builds manually before ansible came in picture , we automates the builds, we use ansible to do the deployment
