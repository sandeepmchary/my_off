Q4. What are the uses of Version control?

 
Ans.

    Revert files back to a previous state.
    Revert the entire project back to a previous state.
    Compare changes over time.
    See who last modified something that might be causing a problem.
    Who introduced an issue and when.

 
Q5. What are the core operations of DevOps in terms of development and Infrastructure?

 

Ans. The core operations of DevOps are: application development, code developing, code coverage, unit testing, packaging, deployment with infrastructure, provisioning, configuration, orchestration, and deployment.

 
Q6. Can one consider DevOps as an Agile methodology?

 

Ans. DevOps can be considered complementary to the agile methodology, but not completely similar.
