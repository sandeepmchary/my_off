?? user@debVirtual:/var/www$ sudo echo “hello” > f.txt
-bash: f.txt: Permission denied ??

The redirection is done by the shell before sudo is even started. So either make sure the redirection happens in a shell with the right permissions

sudo bash -c ‘echo “hello” > f.txt’

or use tee

echo “hello” | sudo tee f.txt # add -a for append (>>)
